		<h1>About</h1>
		<div content>
			Studying all the content by yourself is a very unproductive method of learning.
			<br />
			There is a need for a solution for this because unproductivity is a growing problem within students (specifically teenage students).
			<br />
			This unproductivity results in a lot of negative consequences, such as reducing academic performance.
			<br /><br />
			This website aims to connect students to allow them to learn together rather than alone. It's a forum-based platform where students can interact. This is more productive compared to communicating and interacting on a chatting platform, which could lead to distractions.
			<br /><br />
			A scenario where this would be used is where a student does not understand a topic, and requests someone to explain the topic to them via the platform, after which another student would be able to explain the topic to their peer. It benefits both sides since it is revision for the one explaining and a learning for the one who requested it to be explained.
